T﻿he **Computational mathematics for learning and data analysis** exam's project consists of:

The problem of estimating the matrix norm-2 of A for a (possibly rectangular) matrix, using its definition as an (unconstrained) maximum problem. Using:

* A standard gradient descent (steepest descent) approach.
* A quasi-Newton method such as BFGS.

**Skills acquired:**

* U﻿sing MATLAB
* I﻿mplementing from scratch optimization algorithm in Python

**Team members:**

* Michele Morisco
* Margherita Pensa
