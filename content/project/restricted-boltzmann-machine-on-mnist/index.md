Implement from scratch an RBM and apply it to MNIST. The RBM should be implemented fully (both CD-1 training and inference steps).

**Skills acquired:** 

* gain in-depth knowledge of advanced topics of machine learning, pattern recognition, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and understanding their theory and applications.
* To be able to individually read, understand and discuss research works in the field.
* To implement pattern recognition applications, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning models using state-of-the-art libraries and tools.
* To be able to make limited advancements and contributions to the research in the field.
