title: Make your app smarter - Hands on
abstract: "Today, most artificial intelligence services have to send your data
  to the Cloud in order to perform the analysis. With specific chipset
  capabilities, calculations can be done directly on the phone, with less risk
  of data getting leaked or hacked. In this session, I will show you how to use
  HiAI: a mobile computing platforms that make the developers able to run
  artificial intelligence algorithms on device. This is an live session where
  you will be able to try all the development tools needed to use all the
  capabilities of a Neural Processing Unit."
