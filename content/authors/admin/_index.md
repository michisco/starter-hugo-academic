I'm a student of the MSc course in Artificial intelligence at the University of Pisa. In parallel, I'm working as **Lead Programmer** and **Game Designer** at an indie game studio, **GlaringBit games**. My academic interests include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computational Healthcare and 3D geometric processing. In addition, I'm interested in Robotics and AR/VR development.

In my free time, I keep myself updated by playing video games about new technologies and by constantly researching new ideas. Besides, I like traveling and discovering new places.
