title: Create a fine-tuned Gemma model with Keras & Kaggle
abstract: In this workshop, AI/ML developers will learn how to use Keras to
  fine-tune Gemma, a new open large language model from Google, for their
  generative AI applications. We'll highlight how new integrations with Kaggle
  Models and Colab make it easy to get started thanks to community-developed
  resources and support. We'll also explore how to contribute back to the
  community by using Keras to push a fine-tuned variant of the model back to
  Kaggle Models using new publishing capabilities.
