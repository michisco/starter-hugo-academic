I want to introduce a unique minigame I’ve been developing for AR smartglasses that blends visual recognition, puzzle-solving, and AI-powered interactivity on the occasion of the event to show the capability of the Ancheme project, developing in B.K.

**The Game Concept**

In this immersive experience, players are tasked with identifying a hidden sequence of three real-world objects, selected from a small collection.

Wearing AR smartglasses, the player explores their environment and takes a photo of three objects. Once the image is captured, an AI-driven recognition system kicks in to analyze the objects and compare them to the secret target sequence.

**How It Works**

* **Step 1**: Scan your surroundings and select three physical objects you think might match the sequence.
* **Step 2**: Use the smartglasses to take a photo—no phone or controller required.
* **Step 3**: The integrated AI processes the image, identifies the objects, and determines how close your guess is to the correct sequence.
* **Step 4**: Based on your guess, the game offers contextual hints—just enough to keep you guessing, but never too much to spoil the challenge.
